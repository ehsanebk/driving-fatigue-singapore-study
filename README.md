### Summary ###

This study involves data collected from a real vehicle during
real-world driving, in particular from an experiment conducted by Lin and
Tey (2012) on a controlled test track. The study compared a continuous
and non-continuous 4-hour block of driving in a rectangular driving circuit
with multiple PVT tests throughout the course of the study. The data set
includes data from two groups to compare time-on-task effects between the
continuous and non-continuous conditions.

### Instructions ###

The following steps are recommended for compiling and running the model:

* use Eclipse as the Java development environment
* start a new Eclipse project
* add, as an external library, the ACT-R.jar and other jar files in lib directory
* add the model source code
* change the starter file based on the model that you want to run (night A, night B, and Day A)
* compile and run the system
* when the application launches, open the proper ACT-R model and run the model
