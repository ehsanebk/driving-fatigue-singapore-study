### What is this repository for? ###

* summary

This study involves data collected from a real vehicle during
real-world driving, in particular from an experiment conducted by Lin and
Tey (2012) on a controlled test track. The study compared a continuous
and non-continuous 4-hour block of driving in a rectangular driving circuit
with multiple PVT tests throughout the course of the study. The data set
includes data from two groups to compare time-on-task effects between the
continuous and non-continuous conditions.
